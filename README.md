This is the code used to present the results of my final project for my master's degree in Big Data & Business Intelligence at UOC University. 

This project has two main goals. The first goal is to demonstrate the need for a new type of library that can analyze the meaning of a word in Spanish, given that current online translators do not consider the fixed expressions, idioms, and slang that are typical in each language. The second goal, which builds off the first, is to develop machine learning techniques that could solve this gap. 

This is achieved with a dataset from Kaggle (Jigsaw) and one corpus created through the Twitter API, which has been tagged by hand in order to obtain the differences between the Spanish and English performance in the toxic language. 

Each of the steps followed in this project is explained in the final report that gives a summary of this investigation.
